    <h1> üç•Zefir</h1>
    <p>Zefir is a type of soft confectionery made by whipping fruit and berry pur√©e (mostly apple puree) 
        with sugar and egg whites with subsequent addition of a gelling agent
         like pectin, carrageenan, agar, or gelatine. The name given
           after the Greek god of the light west wind Zephyr symbolizes
            its delicate airy consistency.
            Zefir is usually milky white, may be rose-colored (with berries, cherry, strawberries and such), may have green dye if apple-flavored. Chocolate-coated kind of zefir are also a common, widespread version. A more unusual variation has fruit or berry jelly inside, and can also be covered in chocolate.</p>
